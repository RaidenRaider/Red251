# FEATURES
There are a number of different types of updates that have been included so far.
This list is not necessarily complete, but it gives a good list and will be updated semi-regularly

These are notable bugs from original Red that have been fixed

* Not necessarily a bug, but Old Rod can catch more than just Magikarp
